This is a fully functional battleship game that has 2 players that can play against each other. Each player gets 5 ships of different sizes on their boards. 
The players get to place each of their ships on the board, and then they proceed to take turns guessing where the opponent's ships are placed. 
The game ends once all of the ships of a player have sunk. The winner will be greeted with a message in the end.
Faulty inputs are accounted for in this game, and error messages will be displayed until the users enter valid inputs.

All code in this project was coded by Vedik Upadhyay.

This project is based on the official Battleship game.
