            You, you love it how I move you
            You love it how I touch you
            My one, when all is said and done
            You'll believe God is a woman
            And I, I feel it after midnight
            A feelin' that you can't fight
            My one, it lingers when we're done
            You'll believe God is a woman

            I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
            You ain't got a one-track mind, yeah
            Have it any way you like, yeah
            And I can tell that you know I know how I want it
            Ain't nobody else can relate
            Boy, I like that you ain't afraid
            Baby, lay me down and let's pray
            I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

            And I can be all the things you told me not to be
            (Yeah)
            When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
            (Yeah)
            And he see the universe when I'm the company
            It's all in me

            You, you love it how I move you
            You love it how I touch you
            My one, when all is said and done
            You'll believe God is a woman
            And I, I feel it after midnight
            A feelin' that you can't fight
            My one, it lingers when we're done
            You'll believe God is a woman

            I'll tell you all the things you should know
            So, baby, take my hand, save your soul
            We can make it last, take it slow, hmm
            And I can tell that you know I know how I want it, yeah
            But you're different from the rest
            And boy, if you confess, you might get blessed
            See if you deserve what comes next
            I'm tellin' you the way I like it, how I want it

            And I can be all the things you told me not to be
            (Yeah)
            When you try to come for me, I keep on flourishing
            (Yeah)
            And he see the universe when I'm the company
            It's all in me

            You, you love it how I move you
            You love it how I touch you
            My one, when all is said and done
            You'll believe God is a woman
            And I, I feel it after midnight
            A feelin' that you can't fight
            My one, it lingers when we're done
            You'll believe God is a woman, yeah, yeah

            Yeah, yeah
            (God is a woman, yeah)
            My one
            (One)
            When all is said and done
            You'll believe God is a woman
            You'll believe God
            (God is a woman)
            Oh, yeah
